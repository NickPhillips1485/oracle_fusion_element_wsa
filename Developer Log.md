## oracle_fusion_element_wsa

As I'll soon be starting a new role as an Oracle Fusion Payroll Consultant, I wanted to practice some of the required skills, especially in relation to Oracle's Fast Formula programming language. In this mini-project I'll be learning how to use the Working Storage Array (WSA) function in Fast Formula in order to populate a variable in one formula and then retrieve it in another formula.
